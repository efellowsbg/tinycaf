# tinycaf

tinycaf is a small Infrastructure-As-Data framework for Azure & GitHub.

We want to create useful abstractions without robbing you of flexibility and
conveniance.

## TODO

- `-var-file` all files? (bash script for deployment)
- document naming conventions
- document code style guide
- write real tests (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/tests)
